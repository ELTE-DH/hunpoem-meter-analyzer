## Meter Analyzer for Hungarian Poems:

The Python program Hunpoem\_meter\_analyzer recognizes both Hungarian quantitative and qualitative meters. It categorizes poems as dactylic, anapestic, trochaic, or iambic, and provides a regularity score between 0 and 1, indicating how consistently the poem's rhythm follows the recognized abstract quantitative meter. In addition, the program identifies qualitative meters that have an "aaaa..." or "abab..." structure.

The input to the program is the level3\_without\_meter TEI XML files from the ELTE Poetry Corpus, which contain syllable length annotations for each line. To use the program, see the documentation in the Python file.

## Evaluation data:

The file evaluation\_based\_on\_Szepes\_Szerdahelyi.tsv contains evaluation data based on the example poems from the book Verstan by Erika Szepes and István Szerdahelyi, published in 1981.
